#👾 Hey there, I’m Stelios Krom!
Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! 🚀 I’m a passionate Game Developer bringing eerie atmospheres and immersive experiences to life.

###🎮 What I'm Working On
🔹 A 3D First-Person Psychological Horror Game – Prepare for an unsettling journey into the unknown.
🔹 Exploring Game Mechanics, AI Navigation, VFX, SFX, and Game Design – because great games need great details.

###🤝 Open to Collaboration!
Got an awesome game idea? Need an extra hand on your project? I'm down to work on small- to medium-scale projects that push creativity and innovation!

###📬 Reach Out

###⚡ Fun Fact
Even when I'm not making horror games, I'm probably playing them... or thinking about how to make them even scarier. 😈

Let me know if you want any tweaks! 🚀
